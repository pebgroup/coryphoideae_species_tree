# Script for splitting fasta files that each contain all contigs from a given sample into 
# fasta files that each contain all samples from a given gene. This requires that all 
# sequences in the original files are named "sample_gene". 
# 
# Requires a text file "filelist.txt" with the names of the input fasta files. I generated
# this using ls *trimmed.fasta > filelist.txt. 
#
# Prints some gene-level stats (gene name, median lenght, number of sequences, number of 
# sequences kept, threshold applied) to stdout. 
# 
# Recommended usage: samples2genes.py > outstats.csv
